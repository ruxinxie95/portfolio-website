  "description": "\"TriBytes\" is a ceramic modular wall system crafted with the KUKA KR60 robot, marking my first steps into the world of clay, robotic 3D printing, and sustainable materials. This project delves into robotic clay printing, modular wall structure, and intricate pattern design, all while examining ceramic properties like shrinkage, porosity, plasticity, and strength. \nThrough \"TriBytes,\" I learned the intricacies of ceramics and discovered how material behavior shapes both design and functionality. This experience laid the foundation for my future exploration of sustainable materials and innovative fabrication methods.",
