  "description": "This project explores the themes of \"Concept and Symbol,\" moving beyond conventional architectural paradigms to create a fresh design language. It reimagines abstract ideas as visual expressions that gradually take shape as a unified \"building language\" and physical construction.\n\nThe design captures the nuanced relationship between folk beliefs and Christianity in Huian County through the geometric clarity of a bridge. Its sequence—entrance, corridor, and exit—symbolizes the intertwined yet distinct identities of these traditions. Connecting two villages, the bridge balances tension and harmony, merging modern materials with traditional forms to reflect their shared and contrasting narratives.\n\nCan architecture stand on its own—telling a story, conveying intent, and embodying meaning without explanation? This project answers that question through a structure that is more than form or function: it is an idea given life, a symbol made tangible.",
