  "description": "This project explores the themes of \"Concept and Symbol,\" moving beyond traditional architectural keywords to realize ideas in a fresh architectural language. The design focuses on transforming abstract \"concepts\" into aesthetic \"images,\" which then develop into a unified \"building language\" and \"construction.\"\n\nThe projectâ€™s design reflects the complex relationship between folk beliefs and Christianity in Huian County, expressed through a bridge in its simplest structural form. Using geometric principles, the design creates an entrance, corridor, and exit, symbolizing the intertwined yet distinct roles of these beliefs. The spatial divisions illustrate the relationship between two villages, capturing both the tension and harmony of the two religions in a structure that merges new materials with traditional forms.\n\nCan architecture itself tell a story, convey intentions without explanation, or stand alone in its meaning? The result is not just a building or a visual statement, but an \"architectural concept\" and a \"symbol\" given form.",
