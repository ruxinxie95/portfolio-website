  "description": "CONTEXT. COMMUNITY. CO-OP. CORE. is a housing project centered on community engagement and neighborhood cohesion across four scales: neighborhood, site, building, and program details. Drawing inspiration from the functionality and pre-engineered systems of agricultural and produce structures, this project embraces low-cost, customizable design. The prefabricated, flexible system facilitates high-design moments, open floor plans, and a crafted yet low-tech aesthetic, aligning with the light-industrial character of Detroitâ€™s Eastern Market.\n\nThis design combines an economical shell with a detailed, collaborative interior layout, using farmhouse typology as a modern take on the Quonset hut. The project meets the demand for small-scale, multi-family housing that blends with the evolving warehouse district, supporting flexibility and customization to meet diverse community needs.\n\nOutdoor spaces are categorized as public, semi-public/semi-private, and private, defining shared and individual areas based on site ownership and community engagement. This approach supports casual, community-driven living for residents within Detroit's light-industrial landscape.",
