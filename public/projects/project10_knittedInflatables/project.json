  "description": "This independent study focuses on participating in the teaching collaboration between Prof. Sean Ahlquist, faculty and students in the College of Engineering and engineers from General Motors to explore the knitting design process for developing novel pneumatic forms and systems. The study will involve (a) development of skills in programming and running the CNC knitting machine and (b) material exploration and structural testing with students from mechanical engineering. This study explores design opportunities from a knitting perspective view and develop the inflatable knitting method under applicable design process with direct input from industry through the partners from General Motors.",
