  "description": "Using an exquisite corpse compositional strategy, this Fabrication section introduces three distinct making strategies and detailing logics, each resulting in a triad of utilitarian objects. Independently, these strategies yield objects functioning as desk lamps, coat racks, and stools. Alternatively, they can be assembled to form the anatomical components of a floor lamp: the desk lamp as the head, the coat rack as the stem, and the stool as the base.\n\nFabrication tools employed include a 3-Axis CNC Router, Rhinoceros 5 with Mastercam 2017, a woodshop, laser cutter, Zünd cutter, water jet, metal brake, spot welder, and various metalworking hand tools.",
