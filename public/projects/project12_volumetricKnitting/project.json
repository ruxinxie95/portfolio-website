  "description": "This independent study focuses on advancing volumetric knitting methods and exploring STOLL CMS 822 3D knitting programs. The work involves (a) developing programming and operational skills for the CNC knitting machine and (b) designing and testing tensile knits for volumetric forms. The goal is to expand design possibilities through a knitting-centric approach, refining volumetric knitting methods within a structured design process and incorporating insights from industrial design.",
