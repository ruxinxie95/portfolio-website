  "description": "We developed a mold and process that allows for the cast of numerous plaster blocks from a single mold object. Considering the material usage and geometric continuity, the minimal surface, Schoen's Manta Surface of Genus 19, is chosen as the modular systemâ€™s basic object. A pair of the silicone rubber mold and tetrahedron acrylic boxes are used for casting one Manta surface with plaster.\n",
