  "description": "How much material can we save by working smartly with PETG sheets? This personal project set out to answer that question. By creating an innovative interlocking system, I achieved 98% efficiency from two sheets, minimizing waste while keeping the design compact at just 8 cmÂ³ with no extra structure required. To add an interactive element, I incorporated circuit board scripting to adjust lighting based on gravity and acceleration. The project even inspired my lecturer, Mark, who has since continued to develop it, transforming this technique into beautiful, responsive lighting installations.
