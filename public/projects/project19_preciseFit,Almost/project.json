  "description": "This project marks my first foray into the world of CNC machining, where I teamed up with a refurbished 3-axis CNC machine to explore the quirks of walnut wood. Throughout the prototype development, I discovered all sorts of fascinating insights into wood properties, machining techniques, and the ever-important tolerance considerations. Of course, I also learned to brace myself for the unexpectedâ€”like when the power goes out! This experience reinforced the necessity of always having a Plan B (and maybe a flashlight) at the ready!",
