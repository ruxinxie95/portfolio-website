  "description": "\"Treehouse\" is a confidential tech campus project that envisions a vibrant urban context featuring four office complexes, one amenity building, and two garages. The design draws inspiration from the concept of a \"village\" node, honoring the rich history of the site while fostering a sense of community.\n\nIn response to the evolving work landscape post-COVID, this project emphasizes the creation of collaborative areas that invite people back to the office. By integrating these dynamic spaces, \"Treehouse\" aims to cultivate interaction and innovation, transforming the traditional workplace into a hub of creativity and connection.",
