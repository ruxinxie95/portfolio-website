  "description": "In a hands-on course, I took my first steps into generative design with Autodesk Fusion 360. By simulating real-world forces, I optimized the geometry of a bookshelf prototype through 32 iterations. Each pass unveiled a more refined design, evolving into a structure uniquely shaped by the forces it would face. And tada! This experience laid a solid foundation for my journey into the world of generative design.",
