  "description": "We created a unique mold and casting process that enables the production of multiple plaster blocks from a single mold. To achieve both material efficiency and geometric continuity, we selected Schoen's Manta Surface of Genus 19 as the foundation for our modular system. Using a silicone rubber mold paired with tetrahedron-shaped acrylic boxes, we cast each intricate Manta surface in plaster, transforming mathematical elegance into tangible, repeatable forms.",
